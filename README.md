MadLib
======
* Language: JAVA 
* Program: Eclipse
* Origin: UCI Class Project (Majority written by myself)
* MAIN CLASS: src/Generator.java

This program is designed to create randomly generated phrases based on information given from a file as specified
by the user. It is possible to change the file name via the main class (Generator.java). The current default is 
set to `sentences.txt` and a total of 10 sets are created. Two other options are currently provided, however you 
are welcome to write your own files to parse.

The different text files:
* **Sentences** : Creates random, grammatically incorrect sentences from a given dictionary of nouns, verbs, adjectives,
and so on. They can be slightly humerous, and the length varies.

```java
The angry sofa question it and The nose and The mysterious stove as well .
```

* **Facile** : The original intend of the program was to generate a few sets of commands for the Facile programming
language. However it is not guaranteed to be functional. NL indicates what would be a new line.

```java
LET C 0 NL IF O = 4 THEN 2 NL GOTO 16 NL SUB E 18 NL DIV U 18 NL END NL GOSUB 13 NL . NL
```

* **Kral** : This is an alien language I invented with an interesting structure for writing syllables. English has
consonants and nouns, kral has jiza, blen, and lurin. I made this to assist with creatng words, since making up 
massive amounts of words can be very tedious and takes away from programming time.

```java
 d y o l e s l i o l r .
```
